# `PEAS`环境描述
* **Performance measure:** It defines the success of an agent. It evaluates the criteria that determines whether the system performs well.
* **Environment:** It refers to the external context in which an AI system operates. It encapsulates the physical and virtual surroundings, including other agents, objects, and conditions.
* **Actuators:** They are responsible for executing actions based on the decisions made. They interact with the environment to bring about desired changes.
* **Sensors:** An agent observes and perceives its environment through sensors. Sensors provide input data to the system, enabling it to make informed decisions.
